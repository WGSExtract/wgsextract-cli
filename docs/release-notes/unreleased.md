## New

- `vcf deepvariant` runs DeepVariant natively on Apple Silicon Macs with
  `wgse-deepvariant`, WGS Extract's build of DeepVariant 1.10.0 (the
  `macos-deepvariant` release): no Docker, call_variants on the GPU, and the
  same sites, genotypes and filters as Google's x86-64 image (HG002 chr20 in
  about 5 minutes on an M1 Pro; 16 GB Macs fit). Put it on `PATH` and set the
  new `deepvariant_weights` setting in `config.toml` to its weights folder,
  whose files are checked against their published hashes; only the WGS model
  is qualified. `deepvariant_native = "off"` keeps the Docker image instead.
  See [native/deepvariant/README.md](../../native/deepvariant/README.md).
